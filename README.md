# Password-Generator
A password generator is a tool that creates secure passwords by randomly selecting uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters based on user input. It ensures uniqueness and complexity, making it harder to crack. Users define character distribution, and the generator shuffles them for randomness.
